## Discription 
This is a command line interface application which creates a README file for your application repositories. This will allow people to understand how your app works, how to install it, and how other developers can contribute to your project. This README.md is being created with this system. I did all this codeing through out the week with the help of my tutor Chris and a classmate David. So WHEN I am prompted for information about my application repositor
THEN a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of my project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions

THEN this is displayed as the title of the README
WHEN I enter a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions
THEN this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests
WHEN I choose a license for my application from a list of options
THEN a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under
WHEN I enter my GitHub username
THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to my GitHub profile
WHEN I enter my email address
